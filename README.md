# 🛡️ Mentorship: Smart Security System – Arduino + ESP32-CAM + Python

This repository highlights my mentorship role in guiding a group of interns through the successful development of a **Smart Security System** — a low-cost, multi-layered door lock solution integrating **Arduino UNO**, **ESP32-CAM**, and a **Python Flask server**.

## 🌟 Project Overview

The Smart Security System was developed by interns under my supervision as part of a hands-on learning initiative. It combines hardware interfacing and real-time software processing to offer:

- 🔢 Password-based door access
- 📸 Intrusion detection with image capture
- 📱 Bluetooth-based manual unlocking via mobile
- 📧 Real-time email alerts with snapshots

This project demonstrates a strong understanding of embedded systems, IoT integration, and Python backend programming.

## 👨‍💼 My Role as a Mentor

As the mentor, I provided:

- System architecture guidance and component selection
- Support in circuit design, debugging, and simulation
- Hands-on sessions on Arduino, ESP32-CAM interfacing, and serial communication
- Assistance in Flask server integration with camera and email modules
- Project management and documentation review
